# WebScraping-Case-Study
This is a case study I did when interviewing for TDR Capital (got the internship).

## Background
You’re in the market to purchase your first camera.
A friend has recommended jessops_raw, an online camera retailer, as a good option to consider.
Being unfamiliar with cameras you want to better understand the range of cameras offered by jessops_raw, but generally you are interested in Mirrorless, DSLR and compact cameras.
Beyond the products offered by jessops_raw, you want to make sure you’re getting the best price in the market so want to compare their product offering with competing retailers.

## Aims
1. Build a scraper for jessops_raw to understand their range of products and price
2. Make a comparison of jessops_raw prices and products relative to their competition 
3. Present your findings in a few slides
